Reviewing: Googling for tools

1) What's a good site for browsing Unicode characters?

	Googlin' `browse unicode characters`
	http://unicode-table.com/en/
	You probably will never have to browse unicode characters though.


2) I need to make a simple chart, but I'm not allowed to use Excel. What should I use?

	http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/
	Paste your data as text into the little text area, and bam! you have a graph.
	Downloadable as an image or an SVG.

		SVG (scalable vector graphic): image made up of formulas for lines and shapes, etc. (as opposed to an image made up of pixels).

	Datawrapper
	https://datawrapper.de/chart/sIC5q/upload
	Embeddable. You can also take a screenshot.

	Plot.ly

	http://echarts.baidu.com/index-en.html interactive chart builder developed by Baidu

3) I need to spend a few months learning something to make custom interactive visualizations. What language/library?

	JavaScript, D3.js
	* tutorial: alignedleft.com
	* codecademy (generally bad but good enough for learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
	Processing (not really an industry standard)


	* Don't learn Perl or Flash
	* You know Python, so Ruby will be easy + Python has a library for everything
	* For the web, learn JavaScript (+HTML,CSS)
	* C++/C/Java

	* For terabytes of data, you would want Google BigQuery, Hadoop, 
		e.g. Someone scraped all the comments on Reddit and put it on Google BigQuery
		GBQ gives you 1 terabyte of data every month, which is about 4 queries a month for a database this size, 
	* SQL (a query language, not a programming language)
		# For example in Python,
		for row in billion_rows:
			row['name'] == 'Max'
		# will be incredibly slow and maybe impossible

		# Instead in SQL,
		SELECT COUNT(*) 
		FROM dogs 
		WHERE name = 'Max'


4) I need to do data analysis using Python. What are some packages that might be useful?

	For text data (natural language processing),
		Python's NLTK (natural language toolkit) library
	For PDF,
		Tabula (free) (super slow but faster than typing it out yourself)
		Cometdocs (NOT free, but https://www.ire.org/blog/ire-news/2013/05/22/ire-announces-partnership-cometdocs/)
		pdftotext (command-line tool) (for pdf with text NOT text images)
	For OCR (optical character recognition; turns text images into text),
		Tesseract (command-line tool)
		ABBYY FineReader, http://www.abbyy.com/finereader/

		OpenRefine (good for faceting, clustering)
		fuzzy (Python library)
		Pandas (R in Python)(youcan use metaphone in Pandas like in OpenRefine)
		numpy (MATLAB in Python)
		scipy, http://www.scipy.org/ (all the )
		openCV (computer vision)


		SENSOR JOURNALISM
		Arduino

		https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/reporting-from-the-youngest-land-in-the-world
		propublica, public lab


5) My computer isn't powerful enough! What service can I use to get a brand new powerful "computer" without actually buying one?
	EC2 from Amazon Web Services


5) I need to clean data, these addresses are a wreck. What tool do I use to clean them up?
	OpenRefine aka Google Refine (nothing else is nearly as good)


5) What's the process of converting them to latitude and longitude called? 
	geocoding

	What tool do I use to geocode? It depends.
	geocoder.io
	Digital Social Science Center at Columbia, http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dssc.html (has an awesome computer lab that will help you with big mapping projects) (good geocoding service) (in the basement of Butler? library) (These guys have ArcGIS)
	(courtesy of Mr. Roger Miller)


6) I have a huge CSV and need to make some changes to it (removing columns, merging with another CSV, etc). What command-line tool might help me?

	Pandas (Python library)
	csvkit (command-line tool)


7) A web page doesn't have an API, but I need to get the data from it anyway. What's that process called? What do I use?
	scraping

	beautifulsoup (Python library)
	lxml (Python library)
	import.io
	kimonolabs.com


9) I need to make some charts that help me browse through my data. I don't want to use Python or anything too programming-y, is there a tool that might be helpful?
	Tableau (official tutorials are better than others)


10) I need do some intense geographic data analysis. What do I use?

	geopandas (Python library)

	ArcGIS (if you have a Windows machine and you're richer than God)

	QGIS (if you DON'T have a Windows machine and you're broke) (DOESN'T make embeddable maps for the web)

	D3 (embeddable maps for the web)

	CartoDB, https://cartodb.com/ (embeddable maps for the web)

	Mapbox, tilemill

	lots of JavaScript libraries: mapbox.js, mapbox-gl.js, cartodb.js (don't really need to use cool JavaScript tricks)

	http://visualizing.nyc/bay-area-zip-codes-singles-map/

	Google Fusion Tables


11) I apparently need to learn and use a "relational, SQL database." Which do I pick?

	MySQL (reigning champion of the SQL world)
	PostgreSQL (does everything MySQL does but better)
		To install, download Postgres.app
	PostGIS
	SQLite

	CLSQL?
	Access (DON'T EVER DO THIS)

And give me an example of a non-SQL database if you're feeling a little wild.
	
	NoSQL databases:
	MongoDB
	CouchDB

	You can say SQL either "sequel" or "S-Q-L"


WAYS TO FIND A STORY IN DATA:

Working backwards from a headline: To write a headline like "_____ is the murder capital of NYC", break down your dataset into zipcodes and count the number of murders
Start from a hypothesis, answer questions

I wanna make a map!
EDA (exploratory data analysis)
looking for maxes, mins, and averages
finding the outliers


TALK TO PEOPLE


RULE OF 3 PROJECTS: Do 3 projects, and you can get a job



########################################################################
CartoDB, https://cartodb.com/ (maps for the web)

	CRI (coordinate reference system):


1: Sign up or sign in

2: top left, Maps > Your datasets
on cartodb go to /dashboard/datasets/library

3: Download the csv from Slack;
drag & drop it into CartoDB

4: We see a spreadsheet on `data view`
Click on `map view` for the map version

5: Change the background map on the toppish left

6: right-hand bar, paintbrush icon for "wizards"
Click `heat map`
We get "NYC has a lot of accidents" and we're like "Thanks a lot"
Adjust slider values

7: `data view` > Change column names
Back in `map view`
right-hand bar, paintbrush icon for "wizards"
Click `categories`
Change column to the re-named column name

Get rid of unwanted :
You could click the `SQL` icon
You could click the `filters` icon that looks like a bar chart
And select the column,
then UN-select the entries you don't want

QGIS

New data
add nyc.json, census tracts 
	geojson.io
	you draw on a map and it gives you a json
