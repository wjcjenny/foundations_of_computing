WHAT WE DID IN CLASS:

1: join Slack (https://ledeprogram.slack.com/)

2: install Sublime Text (http://www.sublimetext.com/)

3: check
 - your computer user name
 - where files go when you download it
4: make a folder/directory for all Lede stuff

5: get to your terminal
	magnifying glass icon > search: terminal
	or
	applications folder > utilitites > terminal

*Windows: install Babun (http://babun.github.io)
	> start menu > search: env > environment variables > add path "HOME" "/c/Users/MyUserName" (or maybe for Windows 7) "cd C:/Users/MyUserName"

6: In terminal/Babun,

	# On a Mac, the prompt should look something like
	# dyn-number-number-number-number:~ MyUserName$
	# ~ on a Mac means /Users/MyUserName

	pwd
	# print working directory (shows where you are in your computer)

	# Now track down that Lede directory you made

	ls
	# list stuff (sort of)

	cd Desktop
	# change directory, to Desktop
	cd ..
	# change directory, to one directory above
	cd ~
	# change directory, to the home directory (/Users/MyUserName)

*Windows:
	# You're probably originally going to be in /home/MyUserName
	cd ../../C:/Users/MyUserName
	cd Documents/Lede

7: In terminal/Babun,
	shortcuts:
	the tab key
	the up arrow key

8: In terminal/Babun,
	python --version

9: Creating a Python file and running it

	In Sublime Text, (Python)
	(Create a file, and type)
	print "Hello World"
	(Save it as)
	hello.py

	In teminal/Babun,
	cat hello.py
	# displays what is inside of that file

	python hello.py
	# run the code

10: In teminal/Babun,
	reading error messages:

	SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
	(Time to google!)

11: In Sublime Text, (Python)

	# commenting
	'text'
	"text" # you can't mix single and double quotes

	# DATA TYPES
	# quoted text are called strings
	print "Hello World"

	# whole numbers are called integers
	print 10

	# numbers with decimal points are called floats
	print 10.0

	# DOING ARITHMETIC
	print 10 + 10 # This prints 20
	print "10 + 10" # This prints 10 + 10

	print 10 + "Hello" # TypeError
	print 10, "Hello" # This prints 10 Hello
	# We try typecasting:
	print str( 10 ) + "Hello" # This prints 10Hello 
	print 10 + int( "Hello" ) # ValueError
	print 10 + int( "10" ) # This prints 20

12: In Sublime Text, (Python)

	name = "Soma"
	print "Hello,",name

	In terminal/Babun,
	this prints 
	Hello, Soma

	# name is a variable
	# variable names can't have spaces or dashes
	# instead do something like year_of_birth, yearOfBirth (camel case)

13: In Sublime Text, (Python)

	name = "Soma"
	print "Hello,",lastname

	In terminal/Babun,
	NameError: name 'lastname' is not defined

14: In Sublime Text, (Python)

	# For Python 2,
	name = raw_input( "Enter your name: " )
	print "Hello,",name

	# For Python 3,
	name = input( "Enter your name: " )
	print( "Hello, " + name )

	In terminal/Babun,
	this asks you for your name
	and prints Hello, whatever your name you typed in

15: In Sublime Text, (Python)

	# For Python 2,
	year_of_birth = raw_input( "Enter your year of birth: " )
	age = 2015 - int( year_of_birth ) # typecasting
	print "You are approximately",age,"years old"

	# raw_input(), int() are functions
	# functions take something then does something or gives you something (that's usually different from what it took)

	In terminal/Babun,
	this asks you for your year of birth
	and prints You are approximately (whatever age it calculated) years old

16: In Sublime Text, (Python)

	# For Python 2,
	year_of_birth = raw_input( "Enter your year of birth: " )
	earth_age = 2015 - int( year_of_birth ) # typecasting
	print "You are approximately",earth_age,"years old"

	earth_revolution = 365.24
	mercury_revolution = 87.97
	ratio = earth_revolution / mercury_revolution
	print ratio

	mercury_age = int( earth_age * ratio )
	print "Your age on Mercury is",mercury_age

	# writing peudocode:
	# If year_of_birth is equal to 1983,
	# then say "Hooray! Your age is the same as mine!"
	if int( year_of_birth ) == 1983 :
		print "Hooray! Your age is the same as mine!"

	# If year_of_birth is smaller than 1983,
	# then say "You are older than me."
	if int( year_of_birth ) < 1983 :
		print "You are older than me."

	# If year_of_birth is larger than 1983,
	# then say "You are younger than me."
	if int( year_of_birth ) > 1983 :
		print "You are younger than me."

	In terminal/Babun,
	...this does a lot of stuff. Run it and see.
