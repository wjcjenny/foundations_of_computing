TIPS

You'll probably want to google python substrings or how to split a string, and for #8 you'll want to make a list of the names. #7 is a trick question. The ones about finding the 'most' and 'least' will be really tough until you figure out a method. Try to talk yourself through it or break it into smaller, simple steps. It would also be smart to start with a smaller section of the data instead of the whole thing.
