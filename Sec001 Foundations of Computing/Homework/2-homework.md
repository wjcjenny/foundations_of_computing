### LISTS

1) Make a list of the following numbers: 22, 90, 0, -10, 3, 22, and 48

1) Display the number of elements in the list

2) Display the 4th element of this list.

3) Display the sum of the 2nd and 4th element of the list.

4) Display the 2nd-largest value in the list.

5) Display the last element of the original unsorted list

6) For each number, display a number: if your original number is less than 10, multiply it by thirty. If it's also odd, add six. If it's greater than 50 subtract ten. If it's not negative ten, subtract one. (For example: 2 is less than 10, so 2 * 30 = 60. 2 isn't odd, so it stays as 60. 2 isn't greater 50 so it stays at 60. 2 is not -10 , so 60 - 1 = 59.)

7) Sum the product of each of the numbers divided by two.

### DICTIONARIES

8) Sometimes dictionaries are used to describe multiple aspects of a single object. Like, say, a movie. Define a dictionary called movie that works with the following code.

print "My favorite movie is", movie['title'], "which was released in", movie['year'], "and was directed by", movie['director']

9) Add entries to the movie dictionary for budget and revenue (NOT in the original dictionary definition), and print out the difference between the two.

10) If the movie cost more to make than it made in theaters, print "It was a flop". If the film's revenue was more than five times the amount it cost to make, print "That was a good investment."

11) Sometimes dictionaries are used to describe the same aspects of many different objects. Make a dictionary that describes the population of the boroughs of NYC. Manhattan has 1.6 million residents, Brooklyn has 2.6m, Bronx has 1.4m, Queens has 2.3m and Staten Island has 470,000. (Tip: keeping it all in millions is a good idea)

12) Display the population of Brooklyn.

13) Display the combined population of all five boroughs.

14) Display what percent of NYC's population lives in Manhattan.

15) Display each borough name and population on separate lines (without a for loop) (Hint: You'll just be typing out the name of the borough, this is the "bad" way)

16) Print the name of each borough that has more than one million residents.

17) Print how many boroughs have more than one million residents.

18) Print the length of the borough name that comes first in the alphabet.

19) Display each borough name and population on separate lines (with a for loop).
